General chart selection tips:

Whenever you decide to create some data visualization, use these best practices to make it more straightforward and effective.
If you have categorical data, use a bar chart if you have more than 5 categories or a pie chart otherwise.
If you have nominal data, use bar charts or histograms if your data is discrete, or line/ area charts if it is continuous.
If you want to show the relationship between values in your dataset, use a scatter plot, bubble chart, or line charts.
If you want to compare values, use a pie chart — for relative comparison — or bar charts — for precise comparison.
If you want to compare volumes, use an area chart or a bubble chart.
If you want to show trends and patterns in your data, use a line chart, bar chart, or scatter plot.
